# svelte-tactile-svg

A proof-of-concept Svelte 5 component that implements a draggable and zoomable full-screen `svg`. The current version includes basic interactions for dragging and zooming with a mouse on desktop. The next steps are to:

1. Implement pinch-to-zoom for touchscreens
2. Add support for click handlers on `svg` elements that are compatible with the drag functionality.
